# Nothing OTA Updates Index

This repository indexes OTA update files for the Nothing Phone 1, 2, 2a, 2a Plus, and CMF Phone 1. It also includes Magisk-patched boot images and fastboot files for specific models. These resources have been sourced from the platforms listed below and are mirrored on [archive.org](https://archive.org) for archival purposes.

### DISCLAIMER
- I forked this repo for the sake of making a [pull request](https://github.com/quintenvandamme/nothing_archive/pull/7) to restore credits to the original project maintainers. However, [the commit was reverted to an extent after being merged](https://github.com/quintenvandamme/nothing_archive/commit/79090a19f059997659cd7534a527449179e7e69e) with an interesting description, as per the author's discretion. It is worth noting that this entire project appears to be a **mirrored effort, relying mostly on files and links sourced from my repositories and a few other sources that patch the boot images via Magisk**. I strongly encourage the community to support the original maintainers of these projects, whose dedication and effort in ensuring compatibility for various devices form the backbone of these initiatives.

- This work goes beyond mere ownership of OTA URLs; it reflects the significant time and effort invested by the respective project maintainers to fetch and consistently update OTA URLs for all devices, in addition to the providing stock OTA images. For reference, here are my personal repositories, which I have restarted after receivig requests from many power users recently, following the cessation of updates to the latest OTA versions in this project. This halt was understandably due to the fact that the primary source—my repositories—was temporarily made private. I had paused public access and made them private earlier because I did not want my efforts to be overshadowed by the author of this project trying to achieve the same goal without putting in efforts, which is unfortunately the case, as I have been working on this for much longer for the community's benefit, such as: [Nothing SDM Archive](https://github.com/spike0en/nothing_sdm_archive) & [Nothing MTK Archive](https://github.com/spike0en/nothing_mtk_archive)  

- It is also worth mentioning that the [website hosted by the author](https://quintenvandamme.github.io/nothing_archive/) does not provide proper credit to the original projects from which these files are being sourced. In essence, the author is aggregating and mirroring others' work to host on a website, creating the impression of an independent effort without appropriately acknowledging the contributors behind the sources.

- To sum up, let us recognize and support the dedicated maintainers whose efforts keep [these projects](https://github.com/quintenvandamme/nothing_archive/pull/7/commits/8ae031847a06a1088dbc77806c3771b2843ebfb8) alive!
